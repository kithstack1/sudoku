# sudoku
A simple sudoku solver and bad sudoku generator, if anyone knows how to generate a sudoku with a single solution, id be glad to know
The script basically uses backtracking to solve the board .. for optimization purposes .. I keep adding a few tricks to reduce the 
possible candidates for each cell and as such reduce the time backtracking takes to do its final thing ..
